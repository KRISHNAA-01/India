                </center>
                    <p >The history of India is one of the oldest and most diverse in the world, stretching back over 5,000 years. From the
                    urban planning of the Indus Valley Civilization to the philosophical contributions of the Vedic age, India has been a
                    cradle of civilization. The subcontinent witnessed the rise of powerful empires like the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, the
                    grandeur of the Mughal Empire, and the influence of European colonial powers, especially the British. India's freedom
                    struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi was a defining chapter in global history, ultimately resulting in independence in 1947.
                    Today, India stands as the world‚Äôs largest democracy, a vibrant blend of ancient traditions and modern innovation.

                    <h2>Ancient India: The Birth of Civilization</h2>
                    <p>Ancient India laid the foundation for one of the world‚Äôs earliest urban civilizations ‚Äî the Indus Valley Civilization
                    (circa 2600‚Äì1900 BCE). Known for its advanced city planning, drainage systems, and trade networks, cities like Harappa
                    and Mohenjo-Daro were marvels of their time. Following this era, the Vedic period saw the composition of the Rigveda,
                    one of the oldest known religious texts. Philosophical ideas such as Dharma (duty), Karma (action), and Moksha
                    (liberation) emerged and deeply influenced Indian thought. This period also saw the emergence of major religions like
                    Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The ancient Indian civilization was not only spiritual but also made remarkable
                    contributions to mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and language.

                    <h2>Medieval India: Age of Kingdoms and Empires</h2>
                    <p>The medieval period in India, spanning from around the 8th to the 18th century, witnessed the rise and fall of several
                    powerful kingdoms and empires. The Delhi Sultanate marked the beginning of Muslim rule in India, bringing Persian
                    culture, new architectural styles, and administrative reforms. This was followed by the magnificent Mughal Empire, known
                    for its strong central administration, flourishing art, and monumental architecture, including the world-famous Taj
                    Mahal. During this time, regional kingdoms like the Vijayanagara Empire in the south and the Rajput states in the north
                    played vital roles in preserving Indian traditions. The period also saw the growth of Bhakti and Sufi movements, which
                    spread spiritual unity and devotion across the subcontinent.

                    <h2>The Mughal Era: Grandeur, Culture, and Empire</h2>
                    <p>The Mughal Empire, which ruled large parts of India from the early 16th to the 18th century, was one of the most
                    influential and artistically vibrant periods in Indian history. Founded by Babur in 1526 after the First Battle of
                    Panipat, the empire reached its peak under rulers like Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. Akbar‚Äôs policy of
                    religious tolerance, efficient administration, and patronage of the arts helped unify a diverse subcontinent. The Mughal
                    period is celebrated for its remarkable contributions to architecture, including the construction of world-renowned
                    monuments like the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid. It was also a time of flourishing literature, miniature
                    paintings, music, and the Persian language. Despite internal conflicts and external invasions, the Mughals left a
                    lasting legacy on Indian culture and governance.

                    <h2>The Freedom Struggle: India‚Äôs Fight for Independence</h2>
                    <p>The Indian freedom struggle was a long and determined movement against British colonial rule that lasted nearly two
                    centuries. Starting with the Revolt of 1857, often considered the first war of independence, the struggle evolved into a
                    mass movement involving millions of Indians. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and
                    Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played key roles in mobilizing the people through both non-violent resistance and revolutionary
                    activities. Movements such as the Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil Disobedience, and the Quit India Movement shook the
                    foundations of British power. Through courage, sacrifice, and unity, India finally achieved independence on August 15,
                    1947, marking the end of colonial rule and the birth of a sovereign nation.

                    <h2>Modern India: A Rising Democratic Nation</h2>
                    <p>After gaining independence in 1947, India emerged as a sovereign democratic republic with a strong commitment to unity
                    in diversity. The country adopted its Constitution in 1950, laying the foundation for the world's largest democracy.
                    Under the leadership of visionary figures like Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, and others, India
                    embarked on a journey of nation-building, focusing on education, industry, science, and infrastructure. Despite
                    challenges like poverty, partition, and social inequality, India has made significant progress in technology, space
                    research, agriculture, and global diplomacy. Today, it stands as a rapidly growing economy, a hub for innovation, and a
                    culturally vibrant society that blends ancient traditions with modern advancements.
